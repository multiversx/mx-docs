## **Economics Overview**

The MultiversX blockchain economy is designed around eGold (EGLD) - a powerful digital currency positioned for global adoption.

eGold, or EGLD, is the native coin of the network.

- It is **paid** by users and developers to transfer value and assets, create and manage tokens, deploy and call smart contracts, and other similar operations

- It is **earned** by validators, the set of internet computers that run and secure the network and help it reach consensus

This circular digital economy revolves around EGLD, which has a maximum theoretical supply of 31,415,926 EGLD.

In the bootstrapping phase of the MultiversX blockchain 20,000,000 EGLD coins were initially minted. 
Additional EGLD are gradually released into circulation over a period of 10 years until the maximum theoretical limit is reached.

The EGLD minting - or “inflation” - is offset by the sum of the transaction fees. As an example, if 100,000 EGLD are to be minted as per the inflation schedule in Year X, but the network-wide sum of the transaction fees for Year X are 75,000 EGLD, only 25,000 new EGLD will enter into circulation.

As a result, the powerful economic attribute of scarcity is designed to scale with adoption.
