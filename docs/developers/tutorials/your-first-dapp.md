[comment]: # (mx-abstract)

Let's build your first decentralized application(dApp) on the MultiversX Blockchain!

## Prerequisites

:::important
Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- `stable` Rust version `≥ 1.78.0` (install via [rustup](https://docs.multiversx.com/sdk-and-tools/troubleshooting/rust-setup/#without-mxpy))
- `multiversx-sc-meta` (cargo install [multiversx-sc-meta](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/meta/sc-meta-cli/#introduction))
- `Node.js` with version `≥ 20`(guide [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager))
- `yarn` ([npm install --global yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable) )

:::

You are going to use `sc-meta` to:

1. **Create a wallet** to handle your transactions.
2. **Build** and **deploy** a contract.

## Description

![img](/developers/tutorial/dapp-problem.png)

The **Ping-Pong app** is a very simple decentralized application that allows users to deposit a specific number of tokens to a smart contract address and to lock them for a specific amount of time. After this time interval passes, users can claim back the same amount of tokens.

Endpoints available:

- `ping`: sending funds to the contract.
- `pong`: claiming the same amount back.

Rules:

- Each user can only `ping` once before they `pong`.
- The `ping` amount must be exactly the specified value—no more, no less.
- `pong` becomes available only after a set waiting period following a `ping`.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Application Layer - Frontend

For the web application, we will have two pages:

- **Sign in** - The page where you can authenticate using the **xPortal app**, **Ledger**, **DeFi Wallet**, **xAlias**, **Web Wallet**, **Passkey Proxy** or with **Metamask proxy**;
- **Dashboard** - Here, you can either `ping` or `pong`. If you have already deposited, you will see a countdown timer until the time interval resets.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Blockchain Layer - Backend

You will interact with a smart contract that provides the following features:

- `ping`: users send tokens to the contract, locking them for a specific period;
- `pong`: users retrieve their funds, but only after the lock period expires.

The contract also includes several views, storage mappers and one event:

- `didUserPing`: **view** that tells if a specific user has already `ping`-ed (_true_) or not (_false_);
- `getPongEnableTimestamp`: **view** that provides the timestamp when `pong` will be available for a given address;
- `getTimeToPong`: **view** that shows the remaining time until `pong` is enabled for a specific address;
- `getAcceptedPaymentToken`: **storage mapper** that saves the token type allowed for deposits;
- `getPingAmount`: **storage mapper** that records recording the total amount of tokens deposited;
- `getDurationTimestamp`: **storage mapper** that saves the lock duration (in seconds) before `pong` can be called after a `ping`;
- `getUserPingTimestamp`: **storage mapper** that saves the timestamp of the block where the user `ping`-ed;
- `pongEvent`: **event** that signals a successful `pong` by the user with amount.

Think of this smart contract as the API for our dApp, handling all the core business logic.

To test it out, we will use [MultiversX Blockchain Devnet Explorer](https://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com/)—a public test network maintained by our community.

## Set up the environment

Let's set up the environment for getting your first dApp up and running.

### Project Structure

Start by creating a new folder for your project. Let's call it `ping-pong`.

```bash
mkdir -p ping-pong
cd ping-pong/
```

By the time we are done, our project will have three subfolders: wallet, contract, and dapp.

![img](/developers/tutorial/folder-structure.png)

### Create wallet

To deploy a smart contract to the blockchain, you will need a wallet-a PEM file is recommended for simplicity and ease of testing.

:::important
Make sure you are in the `ping-pong/` folder before continuing.
:::

```bash
mkdir -p wallet
sc-meta wallet new --format pem --outfile ./wallet/wallet-owner.pem
```

:::tip
PEM wallets are recommended only for testing and experimenting with non-production code. For real applications, always follow best practices and use secure wallets that can be generated [here](https://wallet.multiversx.com).
:::

To initiate transactions on the blockchain, your wallet needs funds to cover transaction fees, commonly referred to as **gas**.

The [MultiversX Devnet](https://devnet-wallet.multiversx.com/dashboard) offers a **faucet** where you can claim **5 EGLD every 24 hours**. Here’s how to fund your wallet:

1. Go to [Devnet Wallet MultiversX](https://devnet-wallet.multiversx.com/unlock/pem) and log in using your newly generated **PEM** file;
2. Once logged in, open the **Faucet** from the **Tools**;
3. Request **5 xEGLD** to top up your wallet with test EGLD.

## The Blockchain Layer

With the wallet setup complete, let's move on to the backend—the blockchain layer.

Let's start with the smart contract. You will first clone the Ping-Pong sample contract repository from [here](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-ping-pong-sc).

:::important
Make sure you are still in the `ping-pong/` folder.
:::

```bash
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-ping-pong-sc contract
```

This will create a **contract** folder within ping-pong, containing all the necessary files for the Ping-Pong smart contract.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Build the Smart Contract

Now that you have the source code for the smart contract, you need to compile it into a **binary** that the **MultiversX Virtual Machine** can execute. Since the VM runs Web Assembly (WASM) code, you need to compile our Rust source code into a WASM file.

At path `ping-pong/`, run the following command to build the smart contract into a WASM file.

```sh
cd contract/ping-pong
sc-meta all build
```

After running the build command, a WASM file will be created at `output/ping-pong.wasm`.

This file contains the bytecode for the smart contract, ready to be deployed on the blockchain.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Deploy the Smart Contract

Next, let's deploy the smart contract to the blockchain.

:::tip
Ensure that `wallet_owner.pem` is in the `wallet/` folder and that the smart contract is built.
:::

Before deploying, you will need to modify the wallet from which transactions are made. Currently, they are made from a test wallet. To use the wallet you created [earlier](./your-first-dapp.md#create-wallet), you will need to make the following changes:

In the file `interact.rs` located at the path `ping-pong/contract/ping-pong/interactor/src`, the variable `alice_wallet_address` from  `new` function will be modified.

```rust title="Before"
let alice_wallet_address = interactor.register_wallet(test_wallets::alice()).await;
```

```rust title="After"
let alice_wallet_address = interactor
    .register_wallet(Wallet::from_pem_file("../../../wallet/wallet-owner.pem").unwrap())
    .await;
```

:::note
You need to replace with the relative path from the **interactor crate** to the **created wallet**.

The interactor crate is located at `ping-pong/contract/ping-pong/interactor` and the wallet is in a higher-level directory: `ping-pong/wallet`.

To access `wallet-owner.pem` you must navigate up three folders: `../../../`, then into the **wallet** directory.
:::

Make sure to add the absolute path at `Wallet::from_pem_file("/ping-pong/wallet/wallet-owner.pem")`, completing the missing directories above "ping-pong".

This next command deploys the Ping-Pong contract with the following settings:

- Ping Amount: **1 EGLD**.
- Lock Duration: **180 seconds** (3 minutes).

:::important
Ensure that you run the next command inside the **interactor** crate, located at:

`ping-pong/contract/ping-pong/interactor`
:::

```bash
cargo run deploy --ping-amount 1000000000000000000 --duration-in-seconds 180
```
  
```sh title=output
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
     Running `/ping-pong/contract/target/debug/ping-pong-interact deploy --ping-amount 1000000000000000000 --duration-in-seconds 180`
sender's recalled nonce: 12422
-- tx nonce: 12422
sc deploy tx hash: b6ca6c8e6ac54ed168bcd6929e762610e2360674f562115107cf3702b8a22467

new address: erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqymj43x6anzr38jfz7kw3td2ew33v9jtrd8sse5zzk6
```

Once the command runs, review the log output carefully. Two key details to note:

- Contract Address: in the example presented below is erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgqymj43x6anzr38jfz7kw3td2ew33v9jtrd8sse5zzk6
- Transaction Hash: in the example presented below is b6ca6c8e6ac54ed168bcd6929e762610e2360674f562115107cf3702b8a22467

We will take a look at the transaction details. Let's check them in the [Devnet Explorer](https://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com).

![img](/developers/tutorial/transaction_details.png)

The Devnet Explorer will be your go-to tool for developing dApps on the MultiversX Blockchain. It allows you to test and monitor your deployments on the Devnet, ensuring everything works as expected.

With the smart contract successfully deployed, you can now interact with it using blockchain transactions to invoke its main functions: `ping` and `pong`.

The smart contract source code resides in `ping-pong/contract/ping-pong/src/ping_pong.rs`.

The contract includes several view functions for querying information. These are invoked using the [MultiversX API](https://devnet-gateway.multiversx.com/#/vm-values/post_vm_values_query):

- `didUserPing`;
- `getPongEnableTimestamp`;
- `getTimeToPong`;
- `getAcceptedPaymentToken`;
- `getPingAmount`;
- `getDurationTimestamp`;
- `getUserPingTimestamp`.

## The Application Layer

Now that the backend is ready, let’s move on to the application layer!

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Set Up the dApp Template

To get started, navigate back to the root `ping-pong` folder.

Next, clone a simple dApp template that includes the necessary calls to interact with your newly deployed smart contract:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-template-dapp dapp
cd dapp
```

Use the preferred editor and customize the Smart Contract address located in `src/config/config.devnet.ts`

Then edit this instruction and change it to the contract address that you created in the [deploy step](./your-first-dapp.md#deploy-the-smart-contract).

![img](/developers/tutorial/config-screenshot.png)

:::important
Make sure you have [**yarn installed**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) on your machine.
:::

Navigate to the `ping-pong/dapp` folder and install the required dependencies:

```sh
npm install --global yarn
yarn add vite --dev
```

### Start the Development Server

To test your dApp locally, start a development server with the following command:

```sh
yarn start:devnet
```

### Running and Accessing the dApp

If you run the development server on your local machine, simply open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your browser.

If the server is hosted on a remote machine, access it using the server's IP address, like [http://ip:3000](http://ip:3000).

The production build of the app consists only of static files, so you can deploy it on any hosting platform you prefer.

Once the development server is up and running, seeing the _Template dApp_ screen confirms that your application is live and ready!

## Try your Application

You will log in using the wallet created [previously](./your-first-dapp.md#create-wallet).

To do this, you will press **Connect** button and then choose **Web Wallet** option.

![img](/developers/tutorial/wallet_connect.png)

After you access **Web Wallet** connection, you will be forwarded to login on [Multiversx Wallet](https://devnet-wallet.multiversx.com/unlock/pem).

![img](/developers/tutorial/wallet_login.png)

You will choose **PEM** option to login.

### Ping Feature

After signing in, you will be directed to the dashboard where the **Ping** button will be visible.

![img](/developers/tutorial/dapp_dashboard.png)

Click the **Ping** button and you will be redirected to the authentication page on the web wallet.

A new transaction will be created, and you will be asked to confirm it. This transaction transfers the balance from your wallet to the smart contract address. Those funds will be locked for a specified period of time. Pay attention to the data field, where you call the smart contract function `ping`.

After you confirm the transaction, a success message will appear and the funds are locked. You can view the transaction shown in the image [here](https://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com/transactions/af85e8a26f78f1a26d03377b85bd611b218d5e864d5c8788121beb74a9972aee).

![img](/developers/tutorial/success_tx.png)
You can see **the amount of time** you will have to wait until you can **Pong**.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Pong Feature

After the time interval has passed, you can claim the funds by clicking the **Pong** button.

![img](/developers/tutorial/pong_button.png)

Another blockchain transaction will wait to be processed and again you will be asked to confirm it. This time the amount will be zero, as you only have to invoke the `pong` function (specified in the _data_ field).

Once the transaction is complete, a **success** message will appear, and your funds will be returned to your wallet. You can view the transaction shown in the image [here](https://devnet-explorer.multiversx.com/transactions/3959fb90f08265465cf7c87314ff595357e984d636b023fa530a93733d0c3d6e).
