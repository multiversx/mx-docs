[comment]: # (mx-abstract)

This page describes the structure of the `logs` index (Elasticsearch), and also depicts a few examples of how to query it.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

## _id

:::warning Important

**The `logs` index will be deprecated and removed in the near future.**
We recommend using the `events` index, which contains events included in a log.

Please make the necessary updates to ensure a smooth transition.
If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
:::

The `_id` field for this index is composed of hex-encoded hash of the transaction of the smart contract result that generated the log.

[comment]: # (table:logs)

| Field          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| address        | The address field holds the address in bech32 encoding. It can be the address of the smart contract that generated the log or the address of the receiver address of the transaction.                                       |
| events         | The events field holds a list of events.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| originalTxHash | The originalTxHash field holds the hex-encoded hash of the initial transaction. When this field is not empty the log is generated by a smart contract result and this field represents the hash of the initial transaction. |
| timestamp      | The timestamp field represents the timestamp of the block in which the log was generated.                                                                                                                                   |

| Field       | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| identifier  | This field represents the identifier of the event.                                                                                                                                        |
| address     | The address field holds the address in bech32 encoding. It can be the address of the smart contract that generated the event or the address of the receiver address of the transaction.   |
| topics      | The topics field holds a list with extra information. They don't have a specific order because the smart contract is free to log anything that could be helpful.                          |
| data        | The data field can contain information added by the smart contract that generated the event.                                                                                              |
| order       | The order field represents the index of the event indicating the execution order.                                                                                                         |
