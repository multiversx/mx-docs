You can safely store your EGLD by installing the MultiversX EGLD app on your Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X device. We recommend using a hardware wallet for managing large amounts of EGLD.

## **Receiving EGLD in your wallet**

After logging into your wallet, as described above, you will be able to see your wallet address and share it with others, so they can send you EGLD.‌

Your address is immediately visible on the top part of the wallet, as "Address erd1... ". You can copy the address by pressing the copy button (two overlapping squares). ‌

You can also click "Receive" on the left-hand side to see a QR code for the address, which can be scanned to reveal the public address.
