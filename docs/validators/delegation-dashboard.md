## **Introduction**

Delegation Manager Dashboard is an open-source intuitive interface that anyone can deploy to engage their customers, partners, or friends and operate Elrond Validator nodes.

With minimal effort and no coding skills, you can create a custom dashboard for your Validator node(s), and enable your community to start delegating their tokens to it.

The dashboard is also highly customizable, and you can add your own branding, and even add your own custom features.
