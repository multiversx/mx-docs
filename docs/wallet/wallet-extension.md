### Create a new wallet

**Step 1:** To get started, first install the [MultiversX DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multiversx-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm).

**Step 2:** Open up the extension and click on _‘’Create new wallet”_.

**Step 3:** Next, a secret phrase consisting of a set of 24 secret words will be displayed. Safely backup these secret words. We strongly recommend you write them down or copy and store them in a safe place like a password manager. These secret words are the key to your wallet account and cannot be recovered if lost.

### Import existing wallet

Do you already have a wallet?

Then there is no need to create a new one. The MultiversX Wallet Extension provides an option to import your existing wallet. However, to import an existing wallet you must have access to its **secret (recovery) phrase**.

The MultiversX wallet has a set of 24-words, which serve as your wallet’s secret phrase. Using a secret phrase to import an existing wallet does not affect your wallet in any way.

**To get started:**

**Step 1:** With the [MultiversX DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/multiversx-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm) installed. Click on ‘’Import existing wallet”.

![MultiversX-defi-example-welcome-page](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step4.png)

**Step 2:** Next, enter your 24-word secret phrase. You can either enter these words one at a time or you can simply paste in the words using the "_paste_" icon.

![MultiversX-defi-example-import-wallet](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step14.png)

**Step 3:** Enter in your wallet password and confirm this password.

![MultiversX-defi-example-password](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step13.png)

**Step 4:** Completed! Your MultiversX DeFi Wallet has been successfully imported and set to be used.
