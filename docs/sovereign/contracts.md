# Context
The sovereign shard is a completely independent chain with smart contract processing, ESDT transfers, delegation, staking, governance, guardians and all the features the MultiversX main chain has. It is configurable according to the developer, features can be turned on/off, new features can be added on protocol level.

The developer can choose between proof of authority, proof of stake, delegated proof of stake, secure proof of stake models. Number of minimum/maximum of validators can be set, with any additional criteria (like staking different tokens). Fee model and gas token is configurable as well. By implementing the VMExecutionHandler interface, developers can build multiple VMs, which can be connected to the WasmVM and SystemVM as well for seamless interactions and built in composability.

Built-in bridge between sovereign chain and MultiversX Network without relayers:
1. MultiversX to Sovereign:
    - User deposits token in safe contract which he wants to bridge
    - Validators in the sovereign chain follow the mainchain headers and will push to the sovereign chain the header, the bridge txs and the proof for it.
    - Leaders include proofs of execution from mainchain, right now in terms of adding mainchain header hashes in the sovereign chain header, validators verify it and sign sovereign chain block only if all steps are correct. The notifier/proof system provides an abstracted interface through which sovereign nodes can verify and validate the authenticity of data.
    - Incoming Txs are processed by Incoming Txs processor after verifying the proofs. User receives tokens on the sovereign chain.
2. Sovereign to MultiversX:
    - User sends token to bridgeSC on sovereign
    - The validators create a proof on the sovereign chain, for a batch of transfers, that will be sent to the mainchain bridgeSC.
    - Validators add this information to the sovereignChainBlockBody. Otherwise the block is not signed.
    - Leader will push the created txData to the mainchain
    - BridgeSC on the mainchain verifies the proof and executes the transfers.
    - Sovereign validators will notarize the event of finishing transfer on the following sovereign block. By receiving the attestation logEvent directly from the mainchain.

# Chain Factory Contract
The main job of the chain factory SC is to create new sovereign chains, keep the map of all contracts related to the sovereign chains and to validate ESDT prefixes on sovereign chains.  This contract and the others from the sovereign chain stack list will not be owned by any address, upgrades will go through only after voting, and no admin keys have access to any funds. Completely permissionless start, setup and running, without the possibilities of manipulation or unintended upgrades.

This contract will give out a combination of deterministic+random chain IDs for each of the sovereign chains, roughly the same way we do with creation of ESDT Token ID (the project sends the ticker of 3-8 characters and the system attaches a randomness of 6 characters to those). We will use the created chain IDs as ESDT token prefix for the sovereign chains as well. The IDs and token prefix will contain only alphanumerical characters. 

The chain-factory SC will be deployed by us, however we will renounce the ownership, making it self running. And upgrade/modification will be done only through another so called “controller” contract in which we implement a full DAO of voting. The “controller” will be owned by itself, so it needs to be forward compatible, super general. Will talk about that later.

## `addContractsToMap`
```rust
    #[only_owner]
    #[endpoint(addContractsToMap)]
    fn add_contracts_to_map(
        &self,
        contracts_map: MultiValueEncoded<Self::Api, ContractMapArgs<Self::Api>>,
    ) 
```
The initial setup of the contract will be made by a user account and finally it will give the ownership to the controller. On initial setup we will add the map of address to base contract and base contracts to address. This is needed in order to use `deployContractFromSource`/`upgradeContractFromSource`. The list of needed contracts are: `chainFactorySC`, `controllerSC`, `sovereignHeaderVerifierSC`, `sovereignCrossChainOperationSC`, `chainConfigSC`, `slashingSC`. 

We defined the `ContractMapArgs` structure because the contract names are put inside an `enum` because in this context it easeier to check and work with than `ManagedBuffer`. Here is the definition of the `struct` along side the `enum`. When calling this endpoint the `id` field of the structure will have a value from 0 to 6, each number representing the position of the contract's name inside the `ScArray` enum.

```rust
#[derive(TypeAbi, TopEncode, TopDecode, NestedEncode, NestedDecode, ManagedVecItem)]
struct ContractMapArgs<M: ManagedTypeApi> {
    id: ScArray,
    address: ManagedAddress<M>,
}

#[derive(
    TypeAbi, TopEncode, TopDecode, NestedEncode, NestedDecode, Clone, 
    ManagedVecItem, PartialEq,
)]
pub enum ScArray {
    ChainFactory,
    Controller,
    SovereignHeaderVerifier,
    SovereignCrossChainOperation,
    ChainConfig,
    Slashing,
}
```

## `deploySovereignChainConfigContract`
```rust
    #[payable("EGLD")]
    #[endpoint(deploySovereignChainConfigContract)]
    fn deploy_sovereign_chain_config_contract(
        &self,
        min_validators: usize,
        max_validators: usize,
        min_stake: BigUint,
        chain_name: ManagedBuffer,
        additional_stake_required: MultiValueEncoded<StakeMultiArg<Self::Api>>,
    )
```
Through this contract, a sovereign chain can be deployed. Deploying a sovereign chain will cost 10eGLD. The user will send in the txData all the custom parameters through which he wants to deploy the config contract. The chainFactorySC will call `deployFromSource` and set the user as the administrator on top of the chainConfigContract, this in order to make the initial setup easily, before actually starting to run the sovereign chains.

Here is what the `deployFromSource` looks inside the endpoint:
```rust
        let sc_address = self
            .tx()
            .raw_deploy()
            .from_source(source_address)
            .code_metadata(metadata)
            .arguments_raw(args)
            .returns(ReturnsNewManagedAddress)
            .sync_call();
```
After the new `sc_address` is returned from the executed transaction, it will be saved into the contract's storage along side the `chain_id` as the key.

## `deploySovereignCrossChainOperation@chainID`
```rust
    #[only_owner]
    #[endpoint(deployCrossChainOperation)]
    fn deploy_cross_chain_operation(
        &self,
        chain_id: ManagedBuffer,
        is_sovereign_chain: bool,
        token_handler_address: ManagedAddress,
        opt_wegld_identifier: Option<TokenIdentifier>,
        opt_sov_token_prefix: Option<ManagedBuffer>,
    )
```

## `deploysovereignHeaderVerifier@chainID`
```rust
    #[only_owner]
    #[endpoint(deployHeaderVerifier)]
    fn deploy_header_verifier(
        &self,
        chain_id: ManagedBuffer,
        bls_pub_keys: MultiValueEncoded<ManagedBuffer>,
    )
```
Each of these endpoints have the role of deploying contracts that will help the Sovereign Chain work as it should be. the `CrossChainOperation` contract is `Enshrine ESDT` contract that we will cover up next, same with the `Sovereign Header Verifier`. Both of the endpoints have the needed parameters to initialize the contracts and call `deploy_from_source` and register the returned addresses of the new contracts and put them inside the `Chain-Factory` contract storage.

# Enshrine ESDT Safe Bridge Contract
## `executeBridgeOps@hashOfHashes@Operation`
```rust
#[endpoint(executeBridgeOps)]
fn execute_operations(&self, hash_of_hashes: ManagedBuffer, operation: Operation<Self::Api>)
```
This endpoint is responsible for executing and transferring the `Operation` that is given as a parameter. The first checks that are performed include:

- If the current chain isn’t a Sovereign Chain, execution must happen inside the Main Chain.
- Ensure that the Smart Contract isn’t paused.
- Verify that the given `Operation`’s hash is registered by the `HeaderVerifier` Smart Contract.
- Check if the given tokens from the Operation are registered. If they are not registered, a Fail Event will be emitted.

After all these checks, the execution can start. But what does “execution” mean in this context? Here, it refers to bridging and creating tokens from a Sovereign Chain to the Main Chain or even from one Sovereign Chain to another. To understand how this is done, let’s take a closer look at the `Operation` struct:

```rust
#[derive(TopEncode, TopDecode, NestedEncode, NestedDecode, TypeAbi, ManagedVecItem, Clone)]
pub struct Operation<M: ManagedTypeApi> {
    pub to: ManagedAddress<M>,
    pub tokens: ManagedVec<M, OperationEsdtPayment<M>>,
    pub data: OperationData<M>,
}
```

As seen in the code snippet, the `Operation` struct contains a `to` address (the destination of the operation), a `tokens` array, and `data`. Different structs are used for each attribute since they are complex types, making them more readable and easier to use.

### I. Token Payment as `OperationEsdtPayment`

```rust
pub struct OperationEsdtPayment<M: ManagedTypeApi> {
    pub token_identifier: TokenIdentifier<M>,
    pub token_nonce: u64,
    pub token_data: EsdtTokenData<M>,
}
```

This struct describes each token payment within an `Operation`. The reasoning behind this structure is the need for identification, nonce, and data for minting or creating new tokens. `EsdtTokenData` is a struct related to the native ESDT tokens within the MultiversX protocol. If you are not familiar with ESDT tokens, we suggest reviewing our [documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/tokens/intro/) as they are an important part of the ecosystem.

### II. Operation Data as `OperationData`

```rust
pub struct OperationData<M: ManagedTypeApi> {
    pub op_nonce: TxId,
    pub op_sender: ManagedAddress<M>,
    pub opt_transfer_data: Option<TransferData<M>>,
}
```

You may wonder why there are two structs related to “data.” The reason behind the `OperationData` struct is to encapsulate the needed information for the Operation that needs to be executed. These fields will be used for event logging, token refunds in case of transaction error, and execution of remote functions.

### III. Endpoints Execution Specified in `TransferData`

```rust
pub struct TransferData<M: ManagedTypeApi> {
    pub gas_limit: GasLimit,
    pub function: ManagedBuffer<M>,
    pub args: ManagedVec<M, ManagedBuffer<M>>,
}
```

One of the most important features of the `executeBridgeOps` endpoint is the ability to execute multiple endpoints with one transaction. This struct has all the necessary information for the execution of those endpoints:

- `Gas_limit`: Specifies the needed gas for the execution of all other endpoints.
- `Function`: The name of the endpoint that will be executed.
- `Args`: The arguments for the calls.

The actual execution phase takes place in another Smart Contract called `Token Handler`, which will be discussed in a separate section.

## `registerNewTokenId`
The name of this endpoint is pretty self explanatory. It is used to insert an array of tokens inside the bridge's storage. The endpoint is also payable because registering a new token identifier costs 0.05 WEGLD. There are 2 checks:

- If the received token as payment is in fact `WEGLD`.
- If the amount received as payment is exactly the needed amount for registering all the tokens.

## `deposit`
```rust
    #[payable("*")]
    #[endpoint]
    fn deposit(
        &self,
        to: ManagedAddress,
        opt_transfer_data: OptionalValue<
            MultiValue3<GasLimit, ManagedBuffer, ManagedVec<ManagedBuffer>>,
        >,
    )
```
Depositing tokens to the Sovereign Chain is an important feature. One big feature is being able to bridge tokens and also execute other functions from a single transaction. This endpoint firstly checks if there is any fee enabled for the current Sovereign Chain.
If any fee is enabled there is a convention implemented that the first payment sent as parameter to be the fee token. Another convention is that there can only be 10 maximum transfers per transaction.   

Since there is a token whitelist system in place, each token received by this endpoint will be checked for this condition and in the case that the token is not whitelisted it will be simply refunded back to the caller. In the other scenario the tokens will be verifier for the chain prefix inside the `TokenIdentifier` field and with that they will be burned from the current chain the transaction will be happening.
As the parameters suggest, the `TransferData` value can be optional. In the case when it's not, there are 2 checks needed to be done before finishing the process of bridging. 

- Check if the gas limit is under the specified limit.
- If the endpoint that has to be executed is not banned.

The bridging of the tokens happen through smart contracts events. In this case the event will look like this:

```rust
#[event("deposit")]
fn deposit_event(
    &self,
    #[indexed] dest_address: &ManagedAddress,
    #[indexed] tokens: &MultiValueEncoded<MultiValue3<TokenIdentifier, u64, EsdtTokenData>>,
    event_data: OperationData<Self::Api>,
);
```
Events are another great feature of the MultiversX protocol. We recommend taking a look over the [Events documentation](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/event-logs/execution-events/).
# Token Handler SC
The Token Handler SC takes the responsibility of the bridge for issuing and minting tokens. When a new Sovereign Chain will be deployed there will be multiple bridge contracts that will call the same Token Handler.

## `whitelistEnshrineEsdt`
```rust
    #[only_owner]
    #[endpoint(whitelistEnshrineEsdt)]
    fn whitelist_enshrine_esdt(&self, enshrine_esdt_address: ManagedAddress<Self::Api>)
```
Since there will be multiple bridge contracts that will call the same Token Handler contract, those have to be whitelisted so only them can call it. This endpoint has the `[only_owner]` annotation to specify that nobody else but the owner can whitelist any other contract.
The only implied check on this endpoint is that the address given as parameter is in fact a valid smart contract address and if this condition is met, the address is registered in the contract's storage.

## `transferTokens`
```rust
    #[payable("*")]
    #[endpoint(transferTokens)]
    fn transfer_tokens(
        &self,
        opt_transfer_data: Option<TransferData<Self::Api>>,
        to: ManagedAddress,
        tokens: MultiValueEncoded<OperationEsdtPayment<Self::Api>>,
    )
```
This endpoint is the logic for transferring tokens between Sovereign Chains. At first sight it seems pretty simple since it has few lines of code. The `structs` used as parameters will probably look familiar if you read the `Enshrine ESDT` section because they were explained there.

The first step is to mint the tokens received as a parameter. Here for each token received the contract will make a `sync_call` to the ESDT System SC on the `esdt_local_mint` function if the nonce of the token is equal to 0, meaning it is not a NFT token. In the latter case, the contract will send a raw call to the same System SC but for the NFT create function. 
After the minting step, there comes the *distribution* step. If the given `opt_transfer_data` has any data this means that the Token Handler will initiate a raw call towards another contract. Information such as receiver address, function name, arguments, gas limit are specified in `transfer_data`. If the optional structure holds no data means that the given tokens are meant for a simple transfer and with that the ESDT multi transfer function is called.

# Header Verifier SC
The role of this contract is to verify and register up and coming bridge operations. Since this contract has a mapper for the BLS public keys of the Validators, each one of them has to give a valid MultiBLS signature for every bridge operation.

## `registerBridgeOps`
```rust
    #[endpoint(registerBridgeOps)]
    fn register_bridge_operations(
        &self,
        signature: BlsSignature<Self::Api>,
        bridge_operations_hash: ManagedBuffer,
        operations_hashes: MultiValueEncoded<ManagedBuffer>,
    ) 
```
Before explaining what this endpoint does, a quick description of the parameters should be made:

- `signature`: the MultiBLS aggregated signature from the Validators
- `bridge_operations_hash`: the aggregated hash of all the `Operation` hashes, will be referred to as `hash_of_hashes` as well 
- `operation_hashes`: a list containing all the `Operation` hashes

This endpoint has three checks imposed before it registers the `Operation` received as parameter.
The first one searches the `hash_of_hashes_history` mapper, where all the previous aggregated hashes are registere. If it was already registered in a previous transaction, the execution will fail at this point.
The second one is to verify if the MultiBLS signature received is indeed authentinc.
The last check consists of calculating if the hash of the `operations_hashes` list is equal to `bridge_operations_hash`.

After all of those have passed, the `operations_hashes` will be inserted in the `pending_hashes` mapper and the `bridge_operations_hash` will be used as a key for the given list.

## `setEsdtSafeAddress`
```rust
    #[only_owner]
    #[endpoint(setEsdtSafeAddress)]
    fn set_esdt_safe_address(&self, esdt_safe_address: ManagedAddress)
```
The only role for this endpoint is to put in the storage of the contract the address of the bridge contract that will be removing the executed operation hashes with the endpoint described below.

## `removeExecutedHash`
```rust
    #[endpoint(removeExecutedHash)]
    fn remove_executed_hash(&self, hash_of_hashes: &ManagedBuffer, operation_hash: &ManagedBuffer)
```
This endpoint's name is pretty self explanatory, it removes the hash of an operation from the `pending_operations` storage mapper. The only requirement is that the caller of this endpoint the bridge contract which's address is stored inside the corresponding storage mapper.
